    "What are the SOLID Principles?\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLID Principles was mentioned in a paper in 2000 by Robert C. Martin who is famous for his book on clean code and is also known as Uncle Bob. The objective of this principle is to reduce problem from occuring in the first place. Distinguishing between style and substance. It is an aid and not a rigid formula since an alternative to a class will always exist and the term best is moot as it depends on the non functional requirements. It is focused on the ripple effect of from change and how the software fits its intended use. It is a set of principles listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "S - Single Responsibility\n",
    "O - Open/Closed Principles\n",
    "L - Liskov Substitution\n",
    "I - Interface Segregation\n",
    "D - Dependency Inversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these principles enable us to write better codes that are reusable and extensible. It also enables us to perform code reviews that are not just stylistic by articulating why it is not designed well and what and why it should be improved on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other known principles such as <font color='red'>`SOLID`</font> are `DRY` (Do Not Repeat Yourself) and `GRASP` (General Responsibility Assignment Software Principle). To ensure that the principle is practiced properly, static checkers such as mypy and tests needs to be implemented for every classes or functions. Without proper tests in place, refactoring and writing code based on the SOLID principles will be very difficult."

    "We want the classes to have a single responsibility or high in cohesion. But what is the meaning of a single responsibility? This can be confusing and we can use principles such as GRASP to determine the extant of a single responsibility for a class. For the sake of simplicity, we want to ensure that the class has a single purpose that is consistent with the definition of the class which allows for easier reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have an Order class. This class should allow users to add or remove items, check the status of the payment and the total amount that needs to be paid. However, it should not be responsible for performing the action of paying for the order as well. This means that, we are splitting the responsibility of the class into its logical purposes.\n"
